# Developement-Classification

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project I used machine learning in order to classify the level of developement of a particular nation. I used unsupervised learning in order to discover particular insights 
about what classifies a nation's level of developement. The model was able to successfuly recognize well defined clusters in the data which were then used to accurately classify
whether or not a nation is developed, developing or is of the least developed in a dataset of 167 countries.<br />
